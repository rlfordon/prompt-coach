# Prompt Coach

A split-panel web app for law students to practice AI prompting techniques with a dedicated coaching interface.

Built for the **21st Century Lawyering** course at **The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law**.

## Features

- **Dual-Pane Interface**: Practice prompting in a simulated workspace while receiving real-time coaching in a side panel.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Switch between "Flash" (Instant) and "Pro" (Thinking) models to understand different AI capabilities.
- **Coach Mode**: Get specific feedback on context engineering, model selection, hallucination risk, and more.
- **Paste Mode**: Import conversations from external tools (Lexis+, Westlaw CoCounsel, ChatGPT) for analysis.

## Deployment

This project has two versions:

- **main branch**: Designed for Google AI Studio with Gemini models
- **replit branch**: Modified for deployment on Replit with Anthropic Claude API

If you're deploying to Replit, use the `replit` branch.
